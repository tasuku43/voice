# CLI / API contract

The production app will be a macOS menu bar utility. The scaffold also includes a small CLI demo so core behavior can be tested in CI and by coding agents.

## macOS app shell

```bash
swift run voice-agent-input-app
```

The current shell installs a menu bar item, registers the configured voice-input hotkey (default Control-Option-Space), shows a cursor-adjacent recording HUD near the focused input when possible, records either while the hotkey is held or until the toggle hotkey is pressed again, and transcribes the clip through on-device `AppleSpeechEngine`. The HUD exposes connection/listening/quiet state, live input-level feedback, elapsed time, stop control, and stop-to-paste guidance. Loaded dictionary entries expose ASR-friendly `recognitionHints`; those are converted to `SpeechRecognitionHints` and passed to Apple Speech as `contextualStrings` before the same entries are used for post-STT normalization through `spokenForms` as a fallback. Quick Paste is the only normal voice input mode: key release, toggle stop, or the Stop button completes the user action and pastes the corrected prompt. Paste uses `PromptInsertionUseCase`; it attempts Accessibility-based Command-V paste only after that user action and falls back to copying the prompt to the pasteboard when Accessibility access is not trusted. If direct paste fails, the app falls back to the editable preview window before insertion.

The shell also includes Control-Shift-V voice input history recall, local hotkey settings, local recording settings, permission status display, a Privacy & Security settings shortcut, repository-folder selection for repository vocabulary learning, `Local Context Model Status...` for inspecting the saved model without rebuilding, `Rebuild Local Context Model...` for updating the runtime model without candidate approval, and export/import/open-folder/delete controls for local context model data.

Product direction: the primary app contract is hotkey dictation into the focused cursor using a local context model. `Quick Paste` is the implementation of that daily path. Model education happens through explicit local context model rebuilds, not a second voice input mode.

## Demo CLI

```bash
swift run voice-agent-input-demo "くらのコードでタイプスクリプトエラーを直して"
```

Default output is still a preview JSON object for CI stability and debugging:

```json
{
  "mode": "preview",
  "preview": {
    "rawTranscript": "...",
    "correctedPrompt": "...",
    "corrections": [...]
  }
}
```

History learning mode previews local context model candidates without saving them:

```sh
swift run voice-agent-input-demo --mode learn-history --scope repository
```

History learning output includes `historyLearning.scannedTextCount`, `historyLearning.sourceTextCounts`, `historyLearning.candidates`, and `historyLearning.skippedExistingCandidateCount`. It reads bounded local Codex/Claude-style history through `LocalAgentHistoryTextProvider`, uses the requested scope for generated candidates, and does not persist local context model data.

History learning normalize mode simulates rebuilding from generated history candidates and immediately normalizes a later utterance without writing local files:

```sh
swift run voice-agent-input-demo --mode learn-history-normalize --scope repository "project specific nameの設定を直して"
```

This output includes both `historyLearning` and `normalization`, so tests and manual experiments can verify that history-derived candidates would improve the next rule-based normalization step after rebuilding the local context model.

## Core API

Primary text transform use case:

```swift
PromptNormalizationUseCase.normalize(rawText: String) -> NormalizationResult
```

Preview use case:

```swift
PromptPreviewUseCase.preview(rawTranscript: String) -> PromptPreview
PromptPreviewUseCase.makeInsertion(preview: PromptPreview, finalEditedPrompt: String?) -> PromptInsertion
```

`PromptInsertion` is the normal Quick Paste output. `PromptPreview` remains available for paste fallback. `PromptInsertion` returns the exact text that a UI or insertion adapter may paste; it has no automatic-submit option.

Voice-input orchestration:

```swift
VoiceInputPipeline.run(mockAudioText: String) async throws -> VoiceInputPipelineResult
VoiceInputPipeline.run() async throws -> VoiceInputPipelineResult
```

This keeps audio capture behind `AudioRecorder` and STT behind `SpeechToTextEngine`, with mock adapters available for tests and the app shell wired to local AVFoundation and Apple Speech adapters. Runtime entries also feed `SpeechRecognitionHints` so the saved local context model can affect recognition before post-STT normalization.

Local context model:

```swift
SpeechRecognitionHintsUseCase.hints(from entries: [DictionaryEntry]) -> SpeechRecognitionHints
DictionaryEntryLoadingUseCase.loadEntries(...) throws -> [DictionaryEntry]
LearningSource.learningTexts() throws -> [LearningText]
AgentHistoryLearningModeUseCase.generateCandidates(...) throws -> AgentHistoryLearningModeResult
```

The current concrete model is represented by dictionary entries, recognition hints, learning source text, source kind metadata, last rebuild time, and candidate metadata. `LocalContextModelDataUseCase.rebuildModel(...)` persists a rebuilt model after explicit learning-source runs. `DictionaryEntryLoadingUseCase` loads seed entries, contextual entries, and saved `LocalContextModel.postSTTEntries` for the hotkey runtime, while `JSONLocalContextModelRepository` persists the model as a first-class local document.

Preview fallback insertion use case:

```swift
PromptPreviewUseCase.makeInsertion(preview: PromptPreview, finalEditedPrompt: String?) -> PromptInsertion
```

This returns only the prompt text to insert. It does not generate learning candidates, persist entries, or submit automatically.

Insertion use case:

```swift
PromptInsertionUseCase.insert(_ prompt: PromptInsertion, afterUserAction: Bool) throws
```

Insertion requires `afterUserAction = true` and always passes `submitAutomatically = false` to the insertion adapter.

Local context model data use case:

```swift
LocalContextModelDataUseCase.exportModel() throws -> LocalContextModel
LocalContextModelDataUseCase.importModel(_ model: LocalContextModel) throws
LocalContextModelDataUseCase.rebuildModel(...) throws -> LocalContextModel
LocalContextModelDataUseCase.deleteLocalContextModel() throws
```

These operations apply to the saved local context model document used for STT recognition hints and post-STT transforms.
The app also exposes a status action that reads the saved model and shows last rebuild time, source kinds, source text counts, generated candidates, runtime entry count, and stale-source warnings without rebuilding.

Voice input history:

```swift
VoiceInputHistoryUseCase.record(prompt: String) throws
VoiceInputHistoryUseCase.recentEntries() throws -> [VoiceInputHistoryEntry]
```

Voice input history stores pasted final prompts locally for recall. It does not store raw audio or raw transcripts, and it is separate from local context model data.

App settings:

```swift
AppSettings(
    repositoryPath: String?,
    recordingDurationSeconds: TimeInterval,
    speechLocaleIdentifier: String,
    voiceInputShortcut: KeyboardShortcut,
    voiceInputTriggerMode: VoiceInputTriggerMode
)
```

Missing settings decode to local defaults: four seconds of recording, `ja-JP` speech recognition, Control-Option-Space voice-input hotkey, and press-and-hold trigger mode. Runtime use clamps recording duration to 1...30 seconds and falls back to `ja-JP` when the stored locale is blank.

The macOS menu bar shell exposes recording settings locally through `Recording Settings...` and hotkey settings through `Hotkey Settings...`; changing them affects later recordings only and does not upload audio or transcripts.

Runtime voice input currently stays global: repository folders do not implicitly change the dictionary used by hotkey recording, Apple Speech hints, or post-STT normalization. Repository folders are learning-source configuration, so repository context is included through explicit source selection and bounded model rebuilds rather than implicit broad scans.

Permission status use case:

```swift
PermissionStatusUseCase.currentStatus() -> PermissionStatusSnapshot
```

The macOS shell displays microphone, speech recognition, Accessibility paste, and Input Monitoring hotkey states through `Permission Status...`. It also writes these statuses to the debug log at launch, requests Input Monitoring and Accessibility access when needed, and exposes `Open Voice Input Permissions...` to open the missing macOS Privacy settings for global push-to-talk hotkeys and automatic paste. Recording and transcription permission prompts remain part of the explicit recording flow.

These APIs must remain deterministic and testable without macOS permissions.
